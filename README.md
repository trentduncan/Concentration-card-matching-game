## Setup

-Open the index.html on your default browser, and a window will pop up prompting the user to start the game. 
-By clicking ok the game will begin.

## Rules

-Concentration is a game where the player must match all of the cards to win. 
-At the beginning of the game all 16 cards are randomly arranged and face down. 
-Each turn consists of flipping over two cards, when the cards are flipped up but not a match they will remain blue. 
-If they are a match then they will turn purple and both stay up, if not then they are both flipped face down again.
-Once the player can make all of the matches the game is won and a pop up will appear with all of the users stats.
-The pop up will also prompt the player to play again. If they want to play again they can press ok.
-At any point during the game the button at the top right of the board can be pressed to reset the board.

## Dependencies

-This game is reliant on the files index.html, app.css, app.js, hypnotize.png, and an updated browser. 
-This code was written in Javascript 1.7, and uses the JQuery 1.11.2 library to make dynamic changes to the HTML5 code. 
-JQuery's 'click' functions were used to change CSS classes which were tailored to make a distinction between cards that were face down, flipped up, or a match.
